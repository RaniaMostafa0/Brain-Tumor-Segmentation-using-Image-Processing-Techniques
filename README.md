Overview:
- This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans using image processing techniques. It applies Otsu thresholding, morphological operations, and watershed segmentation to accurately identify tumor regions.

Features:
1) Skull Stripping: Removes non-brain regions for better segmentation.
2) Otsu Thresholding: Determines the optimal threshold automatically.
3) Morphological Operations: Enhances image clarity and removes noise.
4) Watershed Segmentation: Precisely identifies tumor boundaries.
5) Visualization: Step-by-step output display for better understanding.
